            Study Sage is a project created by a group of teenagers from
            <a href="https://imaginescholar.org/" target="_blank"
              >Imagine Scholar</a
            >, a non-profit organization located in Nkomazi aimed at creating a
            network of extraordinary thinkers and doers who solve interesting
            problem.

          <p>
            We have identified that many of our peers in high school are not
            perfoming well academically, and one of the reasons could be due to
            the lack of exposure to different learning strategies that could
            help during the learning/studying process. With that we created
            Study Sage, a website where our peers could easily access and be
            equipped with learning strategies.
